# [go-algorithms]: Algorithms in Golang

## Description

This repository contains Golang implementations of various algorithms discussed in my blog posts. Each algorithm is accompanied by clear code, comments, and visualizations and performance analysis. This project aims to provide a practical learning resource for programmers interested in exploring algorithms and their real-world applications.

## Features

- üöÄ Implementations of diverse algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal)
- üß† Code written in Golang for clarity and efficiency
- üìù Detailed comments explaining the algorithm logic
- üìä Visualization of algorithm steps for better understanding
- ‚öñÔ∏è  Performance analysis comparing different algorithm implementations

## Folder Structure

- `/algorithms`: Subdirectory containing implementations of individual algorithms
  - Each algorithm gets its own folder (e.g., `/algorithms/sorting/bubble_sort.go`)
- `/README.md`: This file (you're reading it!)
- `/go.mod`: Module definition file

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run `go mod download` to download dependencies.
4. You're ready to explore the code!

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to fork the repository, implement new algorithms, or improve existing ones. Please follow the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.
